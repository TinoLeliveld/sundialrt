## Introduction
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) describe the rate of change of dependent variables with respect to a single independent variable and are used in many fields to model behavior of the system. There are many good C libraries available to solve (i.e., integrate systems of ODEs) and [SUNDIALS](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software) available from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is a C library for solving non-stiff and stiff systems of ODEs.
